# Assessing-the-Effectiveness-of-Government-Scheme-in-Animal-Husbandry-A-Balanced-Scorecard-Approach
# Summary of the Project
This project evaluates the effectiveness of the National Livestock Mission (NLM) using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and CIMAS approaches to assess its impact on poultry farming in Jharkhand. It covers financial, customer, internal process, and learning perspectives.

# Objectives and Motivation
Assess the real-world performance of the NLM poultry scheme in rural Jharkhand.

Identify strengths and gaps in implementation.

Provide data-driven insights for better policy planning.

Promote rural livelihood, women empowerment, and sustainable livestock practices.

# Methodology
# 1. Balanced Scorecard (BSC)
Used to evaluate the scheme from four perspectives:

Financial (e.g., ROI, profit per chicken),

Customer (e.g., satisfaction, retention),

Internal Processes (e.g., mortality rate, feed efficiency),

Learning & Growth (e.g., training hours, tech adoption).

# 2. CIMAS (Criteria Importance Assessment)
Used expert opinion to assign weights to each KPI.

Ensured that evaluation considers expert experience and field relevance.

Provided a robust, weighted performance index.

# Data Sources
Government Portals: Baseline KPIs from 2022â€“23 gathered from official reports.

Field Study: Primary data collected from poultry farmers in Angara Block, Ranchi District with support from JSLPS and Department of Animal Husbandry, Jharkhand.

# Result Highlights
Financial indicators showed improvement in ROI and gross margin.

Customer indicators revealed delays and communication gaps.

Internal metrics showed moderate improvement in hatchery yield and feed efficiency.

Learning & Growth was the weakest, with limited training and tech adoption.

The overall performance index reflects both success and key areas for policy improvement.
