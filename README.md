# Assessing-the-Effectiveness-of-Government-Scheme-in-Animal-Husbandry-A-Balanced-Scorecard-Approach
# Summary of the Project
This project evaluates the effectiveness of the National Livestock Mission (NLM) using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and CIMAS approaches to assess its impact on poultry farming in Jharkhand. It covers financial, customer, internal process, and learning perspectives.

# Objectives 
* Assess the real-world performance of the NLM poultry scheme in rural Jharkhand.
* Identify strengths and gaps in implementation.
* Provide data-driven insights for better policy planning.
* Promote rural livelihood, women empowerment, and sustainable livestock practices.

# Motivation (Rationale Behind the Study)
I chose to work on this project because I wanted to 
* Understand how government schemes are helping people in rural and tribal areas, especially in Jharkhand. 
* Many tribal families in these regions depend on small-scale businesses like poultry farming for their income.
* I was motivated by the idea that with the right support—like training, funding, and resources these small businesses can grow and change lives. 
* The National Livestock Mission (NLM) is one such government scheme that supports poultry farming. I wanted to study how this scheme works in real life, whether it's actually benefiting people, and how its performance can be measured in a clear and fair way.
* This study also gave me a chance to explore how tools like the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and  Criteria Importance Assessment (CIMAS) method can be used to measure performance of any business.. 
* I found it important to evaluate the scheme properly so we can learn what is working well and what can be improved in the future.

# Methodology
# 1. Balanced Scorecard (BSC)
Used to evaluate the scheme from four perspectives:
Financial (e.g., ROI, profit per chicken),
Customer (e.g., satisfaction, retention),
Internal Processes (e.g., mortality rate, feed efficiency),
Learning & Growth (e.g., training hours, tech adoption).

# 2. CIMAS (Criteria Importance Assessment)
Used expert opinion to assign weights to each KPI.
Ensured that evaluation considers expert experience and field relevance.
Provided a robust, weighted performance index.

# Data Sources
Government Portals: Baseline KPIs from 2022–23 gathered from official reports.
Field Study: Primary data collected from poultry farmers in Angara Block, Ranchi District with support from JSLPS and Department of Animal Husbandry, Jharkhand.

# Result Highlights
Financial indicators showed improvement in ROI and gross margin.
Customer indicators revealed delays and communication gaps.
Internal metrics showed moderate improvement in hatchery yield and feed efficiency.

Learning & Growth was the weakest, with limited training and tech adoption.

The overall performance index reflects both success and key areas for policy improvement.
